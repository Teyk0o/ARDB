Its incredible durability and lethal arsenal make it the single greatest threat on the map; attempting to scratch its armor alone is a fool's errand—you'll need a full squad of Raiders working in concert just to stand a chance.\n\nIts attacks are devastating:\n\nMortar Barrage: The dome atop the unit launches three massive mortars that land in a cluster around a targeted Raider. Two seconds after impact, they detonate in a fiery, engulfing inferno.\n\nSustained Laser: It periodically sweeps its primary weapon, firing a continuous laser beam at any Raider it acquires in its line-of-sight.\n\nClose-Quarters Deterrents: Should Raiders try to get up close and personal, the Goliath switches modes, delivering either a disruptive EMP pulse to shut down technology or a crushing ground slam to obliterate anything nearby."

While individually fragile, its primary danger is its role as an aerial alarm system. Once it spots Raiders, it immediately triggers a wide-band signal, effectively calling in a wave of flying ARC reinforcements—usually a swarm of Wasps or Hornets—to descend on your position. Taking it out before it completes its transmission is essential, as its light frame means a single, well-aimed burst will shatter it."

Its final attack is a relentless one: it will roll directly at high speed toward any Raider it detects, essentially turning itself into a giant, high-impact bowling ball."

It uses dark, indoor spaces—particularly the undersides of ceilings and dark corners of walls—as its hunting ground. It waits in absolute stillness until a Raider passes underneath. Then, without warning, it lunges for your head, aiming to latch directly onto your face or helmet. Once attached, it relentlessly drains your health and shield meter simultaneously. The panic is compounded by the fact that you must hold the [Interact] button to forcibly pry the parasite off, an agonizing process that leaves you exposed to other threats."

You'll almost never encounter a Wasp alone; they operate in tight patrols alongside other Wasps or as escorts for their more dangerous counterpart, the Hornet. The moment it turns aggressive, look for a small red laser to lock onto you for one second—that's your cue to dodge before it unleashes a quick 1.5-second burst of gunfire."
