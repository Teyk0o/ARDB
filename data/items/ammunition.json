It rarely operates alone, preferring to patrol the skies alongside a swarm of Wasps or to act as an aerial shield for a larger, ground-based ARC. Its main attack is a focused, high-speed projectile. Watch for the brief, one-second pulse of a red aiming laser—that's your warning before it fires a specialized stun round designed to shred Raider shields and tear through light armor almost instantly."
